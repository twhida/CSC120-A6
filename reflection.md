- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    I understand inheritance to the extent that there are certain templates of classes that can be useful to extend when creating child classes that are, in principle, very similar. Although I was only able to get to this project now, I am glad that I understand inheritance and would like to continue to practice experimenting with it in the game that my partner and I created for our final project.

    What I had the most trouble with in this assigment was in modifying the constructor for each childclass/subclass. I kept on making the mistake of modifying the parameters that the childclass constructor was taking in, in addition to initializing it in the constructor. This conflicted with the superclass that the class was trying to extend, and thus resulted in many red error squiggles that I ultimately was able to debug for.



    Once I recognized that consistency in using the correct parameters was crucial, I was able to navigate the Cafe inventory much better. Otherwise, I found the Library class and the House class to be generally straight forward given the very careful instructions in the README.md. I will note that I had trouble with the HashTable equals command that had I employed successfully, would have been more applicable to my printCollection at the end. I was unable to specify between books that are checked out but in the collection, and those which are simply not in the collection.

    I am also very pleased with my growing comfort with javadoc style comments, although I was unable to finish them for this assignment due to time.
